# ZAO Fractal Bot

Discord bot for running ZAO Fractal voting — a fractal democracy system where small groups reach consensus on contribution rankings and earn onchain Respect tokens.

Based on the [Respect Game](https://edenfractal.com/fractal-decision-making-processes) pioneered by Eden Fractal and Optimism Fractal.

## How It Works

1. **Group up** — 2-6 people join a voice channel
2. **Start fractal** — Facilitator runs `/zaofractal`, confirms members, then enters the fractal number and group number via a popup modal
3. **Vote** — Members vote on who contributed most using colored button UI (Levels 6 → 1). Each round, the bot joins voice to play an audio ping and posts a voting link in the voice channel text chat.
4. **Results** — Bot posts a rich embed to the general channel with final rankings, Respect points earned, and a one-click link to submit results onchain
5. **Earn Respect** — Rankings are submitted to the ZAO Respect contract on Optimism via [zao.frapps.xyz](https://zao.frapps.xyz)

### Respect Points (Year 2 — 2x Fibonacci)

| Rank | Level | Respect |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1st  | 6     | 110     |
| 2nd  | 5     | 68      |
| 3rd  | 4     | 42      |
| 4th  | 3     | 26      |
| 5th  | 2     | 16      |
| 6th  | 1     | 10      |

## Introduction Lookup

The `/intro` command lets anyone look up a member's introduction from the #intros channel:

- **Cached** — Intros are fetched once from channel history and cached in `data/intros.json`
- **Rich embed** — Shows intro text, link to their [thezao.com](https://thezao.com) community page, and wallet address if registered
- **Admin refresh** — `/admin_refresh_intros` rebuilds the entire cache from channel history

## Proposal & Curation System

Community proposals and project curation with threaded discussion and Respect-weighted voting:

- **`/propose`** — Create a proposal (Text, Governance, or Funding type)
  - **Text/Funding** — Yes / No / Abstain voting buttons
  - **Governance** — Custom options entered via modal (up to 5 choices)
  - Each proposal gets its own discussion thread in the dedicated #proposals channel
- **`/curate`** — Quick yes/no vote for project curation (e.g. Artizen Fund projects)
  - Accepts a project name or URL — auto-extracts name from URL slugs
  - Optional `description` and `image` parameters for richer embeds
  - Best-effort Open Graph scraper auto-fills title, description, and thumbnail from project URLs
  - Clickable embed title links directly to the project page
- **Thread visibility** — All proposal threads are created in the dedicated #proposals channel so everyone can see and vote
- **#general notifications** — New proposals post a notification to #general with a clickable link to #proposals
- **7-day auto-expiry** — Proposals automatically close after 7 days with final results posted to the thread
- **Live vote tallies** — Proposal embeds auto-update after each vote with progress bars showing weighted results
- **Proposals channel index** — Pinned active proposals list auto-updates on create/close
- **Persistent votes** — Voting buttons survive bot restarts
- **Respect-weighted** — Vote power = your total onchain Respect (OG + ZOR). Must hold Respect tokens and have a registered wallet to vote.
- **Admin controls** — Close voting to post final results, or delete proposals entirely

## Respect Leaderboard

### Discord (`/leaderboard`)
- Queries all 131 wallets' OG + ZOR balances via raw JSON-RPC `eth_call`
- Shows **top 10 inline** in Discord with name, total Respect, and OG/ZOR breakdown
- 5-minute cache for fast responses
- Links to the full web leaderboard at [thezao.com/zao-leaderboard](https://www.thezao.com/zao-leaderboard)

### Web ([zao-fractal.vercel.app/leaderboard](https://zao-fractal.vercel.app/leaderboard))
- Multicall3 batch queries across 130+ member wallets
- Searchable, sortable table with top-3 medal highlights
- Member names link to individual profile pages

## Hats Protocol Integration

The bot integrates with [Hats Protocol](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/) for role-based governance:

- **`/hats`** — View the ZAO Hats tree structure showing all roles and wearers
- **`/hat <name>`** — View details about a specific hat (description, wearers, eligibility)
- **`/myhats`** — See which hats you wear based on your registered wallet
- **`/claimhat`** — Get a link to claim eligible hats on the Hats Protocol app
- **Admin hat-role sync** — Link onchain hats to Discord roles for automatic syncing

## Offchain Respect Dashboard

Web dashboard replacing Airtable for tracking all three Respect types:

### Public Pages
- **`/respect`** — Combined leaderboard showing OG Respect (ERC-20), ZOR Respect (ERC-1155), and offchain fractal Respect per member with stat cards and sortable table
- **`/members/[slug]`** — Individual member profiles with fractal history, contribution log, and Respect breakdown

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- **Discord OAuth** — Login with Discord, requires Supreme Admin role
- **Members tab** — Searchable roster of all members with wallet and intro status
- **Contributions tab** — Log contributions (intro, attendance, special) that earn OG Respect
- **Allocations tab** — Queue of pending OG Respect distributions, mark as distributed or cancelled

### API Routes

| Route | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| `/api/dashboard/leaderboard` | GET | Public | Combined leaderboard (onchain + offchain) |
| `/api/dashboard/stats` | GET | Public | Aggregate stats for header cards |
| `/api/dashboard/members/[slug]` | GET | Public | Full member profile data |
| `/api/dashboard/activity` | GET | Public | Recent activity feed |
| `/api/admin/contributions` | GET/POST | Admin | List/create contributions |
| `/api/admin/allocations` | GET/POST | Admin | List/create allocations |
| `/api/admin/allocations/[id]` | PATCH | Admin | Mark distributed/cancelled |
| `/api/admin/members` | GET | Admin | Full member roster with status |

## Fractal History & Stats

Every completed fractal is automatically logged to `data/history.json`:

- **`/history [query]`** — Search past fractals by member name, group name, or fractal number
- **`/mystats [@user]`** — View cumulative Respect earned, participation count, podium finishes, and recent fractals
- **`/rankings`** — Cumulative Respect leaderboard from all recorded fractal history
- Auto-records rankings, Respect points, facilitator, fractal/group number, and timestamp

## Presentation Timer

Run `/timer` before voting to give each member structured speaking time:

- **Auto-detects speakers** from your voice channel (2-6 members)
- **Live countdown** using Discord's built-in relative timestamps (updates client-side)
- **Facilitator controls** — Skip, Pause, Resume, and Stop buttons
- **`/timer_add`** — Add extra minutes to the current speaker if needed
- **Shuffle option** — Randomize speaker order with `shuffle: True`
- When all speakers finish, the bot announces "Ready to begin voting!"

## Wallet System

The bot maps Discord users to Ethereum wallet addresses for onchain submission:

- **`/register`** — Users self-register their wallet address or ENS name (e.g. `vitalik.eth` → auto-resolves to `0x...` using Keccak-256 namehash)
- **Name matching** — 130+ pre-loaded name→wallet mappings in `data/names_to_wallets.json` auto-match by Discord display name
- **Admin override** — Admins can register wallets or ENS names for any user with `/admin_register`
- **`/admin_match_all`** — Shows which server members already have wallets matched

When a fractal completes, the bot generates a pre-filled `zao.frapps.xyz/submitBreakout` link with all ranked wallet addresses and @mentions everyone to go vote.

## Voice Channel Notifications

Each voting round, the bot:
- **Sends a link** to the voting thread in the voice channel's text chat so members can click through
- **Plays an audio ping** by joining the voice channel, playing a short ding sound, then disconnecting

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Discord bot token with Message Content, Members, and Guilds intents
- ffmpeg (for voice channel audio pings) — `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS

### Install & Run (Local)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config/.env.template .env
# Edit .env with your DISCORD_TOKEN
python3 main.py
```

### Web App (Local)

```bash
cd web
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with database URL, Discord OAuth credentials, and RPC key
npm run dev
```

### Deploy to Bot-Hosting.net

1. Create a Discord bot server at [bot-hosting.net](https://bot-hosting.net)
2. In the **Files** tab, upload all project files directly into `/home/container/` (no subfolders — `main.py` must be at the root)
3. Upload your `.env` file separately with your bot token
4. In the **Startup** tab, set **App py file** to `main.py`
5. Hit **Start** — dependencies install automatically from `requirements.txt`

## Roadmap / Ideas

### Scaling (v1.2)
- [ ] **Paginated proposals** — Split pinned index and `/proposals` command across pages for 10-15+ proposals
- [ ] **Proposal filtering** — Filter by type (text/governance/funding/curate) and status (active/closed)
- [ ] **Auto-archive** — Move closed proposals to archive after 14 days
- [ ] **Web proposals page** — Browse and view proposals on the website

### UX Improvements
- [ ] **Vote timeout** — Auto-advance or warn if a round goes too long without reaching threshold
- [ ] **Auto-split into groups** — For larger meetings (7+ people in voice), automatically split into balanced groups of 3-6
- [ ] **Mid-fractal member handling** — Gracefully handle someone leaving voice/Discord mid-fractal
- [ ] **Facilitator rotation** — Track who's facilitated before and suggest/auto-assign facilitators fairly

### Onchain / Web
- [ ] **Transaction verification** — Listen for onchain tx after submitBreakout and confirm back in Discord
- [ ] **Web voting** — Vote on proposals from the website (not just Discord)

### Operational
- [ ] **Scheduled fractals** — `/schedule` command for recurring weekly fractals with reminders
- [ ] **Multi-group coordination** — "Fractal master" view showing status of all groups running in parallel
